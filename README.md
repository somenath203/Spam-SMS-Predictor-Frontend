# Spam-SMS-Predictor-Frontend

This is a machine learning project where users can predict whether a particular SMS message is a spam or not. The front end of this project was created with the help of NextJS and TailwindCSS. The machine learning model is created with the help of Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and both the frontend and the machine learning model are connected with the help of FastAPI.

With this project, a user can provide real-world SMS through the frontend website and get the predicted result from the machine learning model accordingly.
